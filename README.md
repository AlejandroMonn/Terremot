This project is a simple full-stack web application designed for direct currency conversion between any two selected currencies, the primary goal was to learn about consuming external APIs, managing basic UI formatting, and interacting with a cloud database for a public history feature

Key Features

1 Flexible Currency Selection:** Users can select the origin and destination currencies using either interactive buttons placed over a world map image or via standard dropdown search lists
2 Input Formatting:** The amount input field automatically formats the number with appropriate thousands separators (commas) and a currency symbol as the user types
3 Direct Conversion:** The application retrieves real-time exchange rates to perform a direct conversion between the two selected currencies
4 Conversion History: Every successful conversion is saved to a public database and displayed on a separate "History" page for users to view

Project Structure

The entire application is built using basic web technologies in a single directory
